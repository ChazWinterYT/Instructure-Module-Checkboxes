# Instructure-Module-Checkboxes
Adds checkboxes to each module in an Instructure (Canvas) course so you can track your course progress. Created for my Amazon Technical Academy class because the website did not give us this ability.

Requires TamperMonkey. Install Tampermonkey browser extension, then either copy/paste this code into a new userscript, or save this as a file and load it in.
